# Mendeleev's Marvel 🌟

Welcome to Mendeleev's Marvel — a 2D grid-based game that combines education and entertainment! Created as a Minor-2 project during my 6th semester, this game is designed to help players explore the periodic table of elements in a fun and interactive way.

## 🧑‍🔬 Game Overview

In Mendeleev's Marvel, the grid is randomly populated with periodic elements and colored grids. The player’s task is to select grids where the elements are consecutive in the periodic table order. If the player selects consecutive elements, they earn points. However, selecting non-consecutive elements ends the game and displays the final score.

The game offers a simple yet engaging way to test your knowledge of the periodic table and hone your reflexes as you strive to make consecutive element selections.

## 🔑 Key Features

Randomized Grids: The game grid is populated randomly with periodic symbols and colorful grid cells, adding unpredictability and excitement.
Periodic Table Challenge: The player must select elements from the grids being in order to score points.
Scoring System: Each correct selection of consecutive elements adds to the score. A wrong selection ends the game.
Educational: Learn about the periodic table while playing!
